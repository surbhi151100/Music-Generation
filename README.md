# Music-Generation

In this project we take some existing music tunes and then train a model using this data. The model then learn the patterns in music. Once the model complete this step, it should be able to generate new music for us. It does not simply produce tunes from the training data. 
We here are not expecting our model to generate new music which is of professional quality, but we want it to generate a decent quality music which should be melodious and good to hear.
This project can be implemented through many algorithms but we have done it using LSTM.
Run the python file having the dataset in the directory and try changing the epochs, layers and increasing dataset to get better accuracy.
